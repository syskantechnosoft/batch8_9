Data Structure - Way of Organising the data. 

Arrays - You can store similar type of data in a continuous memory space.

LinkedList

Stack - LIFO - Last In First Out
Push - Adding data to the stack
pop - removing a data from the stack

Queue - FIFO - First In First Out 
Enqueue - Adding the data to Queue
Dequeue - Removing the data from Queue

Vector

Trees

Set (HashSet)

Map 

LinkList 

Arrays 

Easy Operations in Array
Adding/Removing data at the end.

Costlier operation in Array
Adding or Removing data in the middle or in the beginning index


Linked List (Single Linked List/Double Link List)


Easy Operation
Adding or removing the element any where other than the last element

Costlier opearation
Adding or removing element after the middle till the end



Case Study
1) Spring Data JPA support (Get the data from MySQL)
2) Lombok, Testing using mockito
3) Fetching the data dynamically by joining two or more tables
